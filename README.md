              an AI-powered system design interview coach skill
```

> *Not flashcards. Not video lectures.*
> *Your AI becomes a Socratic mentor who derives every technique from physics — then makes you teach it back.*

An open-source skill for Claude Code (and 40+ AI editors) that turns your AI into a structured System Design interview coach. 69-unit curriculum. First-principles derivation. RPG narrative. You don't memorize "use caching for reads" — you derive it from DRAM ~100ns vs SSD ~100μs vs Network ~1ms.

## How It Works

```
  You                     AI (小球)                  Your Terminal
  ---                     --------                   -------------

  "let's learn"  ----->   reads progress.md  -----> checks where
                          becomes 小球 (★‿★)         you left off
                          your mentor
                                |
                                v
                          "DRAM is 100ns.
                           SSD is 100μs.
                           That's 1000x slower.
                           What should we do?"
                                |
                                v
                          derive --> build --> teach --> gate --> next
```

1. Install the skill (see below)
2. Open Claude Code and say **"let's learn system design"**
3. Learn by deriving, not memorizing

## The Cast

Characters at **ScaleUp**, a fast-growing startup where everything breaks at scale:

| Character | Role | Catchphrase |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **(★‿★) 小球** | Senior Architect | "Why does this work?" — your Socratic mentor, never gives answers directly |
| **(◎_◎;) Max** | CTO | "Just ship it" — makes bad architecture calls you learn to fix |
| **(╯°□°)╯ Karen** | PM | "Demo is Friday" — brings real business pressure and requirements |
| **(・_・?) Yuki** | Junior Dev (Phase 2+) | "Can you explain?" — you teach her to prove you truly understand |

---

## The Journey (69 Units)

| Phase | Days | At ScaleUp... | You'll Learn |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| 0 | 1-3 | First week onboarding | Interview rubric, estimation, 4-step SD framework |
| 1 | 4-16 | Traffic spikes, DB debates | LB, caching, databases, queues, API, auth, consistent hashing |
| 2 | 17-26 | International expansion | CAP, consistency, replication, rate limiting, observability |
| 3 | 27-59 | Design review gauntlet | URL shortener, chat, news feed, payment, flash sale, Top-K, ride matching + 8 more |
| 4 | 60-69 | Final boss interviews | Trade-off drills, brownfield/legacy migration, mocks, weak spot reinforcement |

Title progression: 🌱 Junior Engineer → ⚙️ Systems Engineer → 🌐 Distributed Engineer → 🏗️ Staff Architect → 👑 Principal Architect

## Derivation Chains (What Makes This Different)

Instead of pattern-matching ("see X scenario → use Y technique"), you derive from physics:

```
  Physical constraint              What you derive
  --------------------             ----------------

  DRAM ~100ns, SSD ~100μs    -->   Why caching exists, where to place it
  Single CPU has core limit   -->   Why load balancers exist
  Hardware fails 2-10%/year   -->   Why replication is non-negotiable
  Light speed = 150ms RTT     -->   Why CAP is a partition trade-off
  Sync call = fate coupling   -->   Why message queues decouple
  HTTP is plaintext            -->   Why every security layer exists
```

13 derivation chains cover all Phase 1-2 building blocks. Each chain defines:
- **Physical constraints** — concrete numbers (the anchors)
- **Derivation direction** — logical flow, not a script (the compass)
- **Micro-exercise** — ASCII diagram, pseudocode, or mental model (Build)
- **Transfer question** — explain to Yuki (Teach)

The AI uses these as a compass to guide you naturally — not as a script to read verbatim.

### Adaptive Mode

| Student Level | Derivation Mode | How It Works |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Beginner / Medium Warm-Up | **Guided** | 小球 walks through constraints → derivation → conclusion |
| Strong Warm-Up / Phase 2+ | **Exploration** | 小球 shows only the numbers, you derive, then compare |

---

## Teaching Methods

Four methods, layered:

| Method | What It Does | In Practice |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **First Principles** | Derive from physics, not memorize | Step 0: "DRAM is 1000x faster than SSD — now what?" |
| **Feynman** | Explain in your own words to prove understanding | "Can you explain caching to Yuki?" not "Do you understand?" |
| **Simon (Chunking)** | Break topics into 5-10 chunks, master each | Can't move to chunk 3 until chunk 2 passes the gate |
| **Dan Koe (Learn→Build→Teach)** | Three-phase cycle per concept | Derive it → build ASCII diagram → teach it to Yuki |

---

## Session Flow

Each session follows 8 steps (~65-70 min). Pause anytime, resume next session.

```
A. Review          -- recall last session + check parked curiosity branches
B. Introduction    -- story hook + real-life analogy
C. Core Teaching   -- Step 0: Derivation → Step 1: Chunk Map → Step 2: Teach → Step 3: Feynman Gate
D. Hands-On        -- PoC in Go (or ASCII design exercise)
E. Simon Drill     -- close notes, recall from memory
F. Interview Drill -- mini mock with 4-step framework + tiered scorecard
G. Notes           -- structured notes + one-liner challenge + cross-verification
H. Progress        -- update mastery, achievements, streak, story summary
```
